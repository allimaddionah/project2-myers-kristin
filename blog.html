                    <h1>How Soon Should I Date After Divorce?</h1>
                    <p>You will have some friends and family members encouraging you to immediately start dating after a divorce while others will ask you to way too long. But remember itâ€™s your life and you are the only one who is going to suffer the repercussions of a hasty decision. So take your time to think about what you want in life before diving into the dating world again. Most people say that after a bad relationship, one should immediately start dating so that they can find true happiness without wasting any time, while others say that after a failed marriage there should be some cooling period so that everything finally ends, and you can clear your mind and heart before beginning to look for someone fantastic? A-hem. </p>
